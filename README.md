Hello!
I study web development and i have some problem with this layout from FIgma (https://www.figma.com/file/s5cWaIgOnFBkaPXv0jDBs4/Lightfolio?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev)
May someone help me? Please.
Main issue is with the featureWork section, in my code it looks like this ![pic1](https://github.com/WOWgreenlord/Figma-Lightfolio/assets/127123901/2c1118b8-7841-4066-8e29-0500b075aa69), if you see, cards are slightly off and i need it to look like this ![pic2](https://github.com/WOWgreenlord/Figma-Lightfolio/assets/127123901/372e0edb-385f-4050-bd67-2bd271fba0a7)
